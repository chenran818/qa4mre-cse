========================================================
Question: Which technique was used to determine the cellular locations of the CLU1 and CLU2 gene products?
0.23634997	Within B, the value in parentheses following the tissue name is the CLU1:CLU2 ratio.
0.23634997	The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that CLU1 translation is generally initiated at the common exon 2 ATG.
0.22525027	The possibility exists that a portion of CLU1 translation is initiated at the exon 1a ATG at levels too low to be readily detected or that produce an unstable protein which is rapidly degraded.
0.22525027	Moreover, variability in these factors could facilitate or obscure the SNP association with CLU1 expression described here, suggesting that replication of these data in additional samples is necessary for their acceptance by the research community.
0.21479231	Since the minor rs11136000T allele was associated with both increased CLU1 expression and reduced AD risk [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], we interpret these results as suggesting that increased CLU1 expression is associated with reduced AD risk.
0.20636801	Quantitative expression studies show that both CLU1 and CLU2 are increased in AD but only CLU1 is associated with rs11136000.
0.20636801	Second, the expression of only CLU1 was associated with rs11136000 while both CLU1 and CLU2 were increased with robust AD neuropathology.
0.20433256	The predicted protein sequences encoded by CLU1 and CLU2, beginning with the initial ATG sites shown in A, are shown in panel C. The sequence in gray font is unique to CLU1 while sequence in black font is common to CLU1 and CLU2.
0.20182973	However, only CLU1 expression was associated with rs11136000.
0.20182973	Hence, CLU1 and CLU2 produce similar secreted proteins in vitro.
=========================================================
========================================================
Question: What compartments inside the cell contain clusterin proteins?
3.457426	Comparable results were obtained in two cell types, suggesting that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce soluble clusterin protein.
3.2302003	Cell lysates contained both intact and cleaved clusterin while conditioned medium contained only cleaved clusterin; the clusterin protein produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appeared equal in size (Figure 4A).
2.8264256	g004 To evaluate whether the clusterin proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to those produced in vivo, we compared ectopic clusterin with endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells and in human brain by Western blotting with a clusterin antibody.
2.3240314	CLU1 and CLU2 produce clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain.
2.194615	Third, CLU1 and CLU2 produce secreted clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain.
2.194615	Both CLU1 and CLU2 produce a soluble, secreted clusterin protein that is similar to that observed in human brain.
1.8717568	We note that the lack of an association between total CLU and rs11136000 was similar to prior reports that total CLU mRNA or clusterin protein were not associated with rs11136000 [17], [34].
1.6136069	Overall, the cellular clusterin proteins are similar in size to the human brain clusterin, as discerned for the intact and cleaved clusterin under reducing conditions (D) or as the heterodimeric clusterin under non-reducing conditions (E).
1.6136069	Overall, we summarize our current results by noting that the proteins produced from CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to each other, and similar in size to those present in human brain, leading us to interpret our data as supporting the possibility that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce secreted clusterin protein in vitro and in vivo.
1.6129236	Although the primary role of clusterin in AD is unclear, CLU is implicated in AD by several lines of evidence, including (I) CLU mRNA and clusterin protein is increased in AD [5], [6], (ii) clusterin is a component of plaques [4], [5], [7], (iii) clusterin modulates AD-related pathways such as inflammation and apoptosis [1], [8], [9] and (iv) clusterin acts as an amyloid-beta (Aß) chaperone to alter Aß aggregation and/or clearance ([10], [11], reviewed in [4], [12], [13], [14]).

Question: Which of the two CLU isoforms is the main one expressed in the choroid plexus?
2.476881	Discerning the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 depended upon analyzing these two CLU isoforms separately.
2.2319365	In summary, the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 was dependent upon analyzing the two CLU isoforms separately.
1.7665968	To gain further insights into CLU isoform expression, we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 in a series of single human fetal tissue samples as well as a set of six adult choroid plexus samples (Figure 2B).
1.6127164	Two CLU isoforms, CLU1 and CLU2, have been reported that consist of nine exons and differ only in their first exons and associated proximal promoters; CLU1 is predicted to encode a nuclear protein and CLU2 a secreted protein (reviewed in [20]).
0.71220833	Additional reported isoforms include a CLU isoform that lacks exon 5 and a CLU isoform that lacks exon two, which encodes the leader sequence, resulting in another nuclear clusterin [21], [22].
0.62950915	Here, we investigated the hypothesis that CLU isoforms are differentially modulated by AD status and AD-associated SNPs.
0.62950915	Results Top To begin to evaluate CLU expression, we screened human brain cDNA to identify CLU isoforms present in brain.
0.62950915	The CLU isoforms were quantified in separate real-time PCR assays that used forward primers corresponding to their unique exon 1 and a common reverse primer that targeted the exon 2–3 boundary.
0.62950915	Expression of CLU isoforms in human tissues.
0.62950915	One possible modulator of interest is age-dependent changes in sex hormones since CLU isoforms are differentially regulated by androgens [35].

Question: Which clusterin single nucleotide polymorphism has been linked to a reduction in the risk for developing Alzheimer's disease?
0.42804495	Abstract Top The minor allele of rs11136000 within CLU is strongly associated with reduced Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk.
0.22080837	Introduction Top Clusterin (CLU, APOJ) has been implicated in diseases ranging from cancer to Alzheimer's disease (AD) (reviewed in [1], [2], [3], [4]).
0.18802635	Find this article online (1997) Consensus recommendations for the postmortem diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
0.15042107	The National Institute on Aging, and Reagan Institute Working Group on Diagnostic Criteria for the Neuropathological Assessment of Alzheimer's Disease.
0.14118384	Furthermore, since CLU expression is increased in AD without reversing the disease, we speculate that enhanced CLU expression reduces AD risk only if CLU expression is increased well before AD onset, mimicking the likely SNP effects.

Question: Which entity does allosterically regulate insulin degrading enzyme activity?
0.59665126	It is known that a small fraction of IDE (ranging from 3% to 10%) is secreted into the extracellular space, where it presumably interacts with its substrates, such as insulin and β-amyloid [8], [38].
0.2636851	Notably, IDE is a zinc metalloendopeptidase that hydrolyzes a wide range of substrates, including insulin, amylin, glucagon, atrial natriuretic factor and insulin-like growth factors I and II [8].
0.26103494	Insulin-degrading-enzyme (IDE) is one of the main extracellular protease targeting Aβ, and thus it represents an interesting pharmacological target for AD therapy.
0.22374421	Human somatostatin was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA); recombinant insulin degrading-enzyme was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA, USA); β-amyloid (1–40) was obtained from Anaspec (San Jose, CA, USA).
0.1864535	Several proteases, such as insulin-degrading-enzyme (IDE), neprilysin (NEP) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) are involved in Aβ degradation [4]–[6].
0.14916281	Somatostatin Modulates Insulin-Degrading-Enzyme Metabolism: Implications for the Regulation of Microglia Activity in ADGrazia Tundo1, Chiara Ciaccio1, Diego Sbardella1,2, Mariaserena Boraso3, Barbara Viviani3, Massimiliano Coletta1,2, Stefano Marini1*1 Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, University of Roma Tor Vergata, Roma, Italy, 2 Interuniversity Consortium for the Research on the Chemistry of Metals in Biological Systems, Bari, Italy, 3 Department of Pharmacological Sciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy

========================================================
Question: Which peptide hormone is the positive transcriptional regulator of IDE?
0.52517056	Somatostatin regulates IDE activity enhancing IDE-dependent Aβ degradation.
0.47840118	This addition further amplifies the positive modulation of IDE expression (Figure 1).
0.47840118	Somatostatin induces an increase of IDE expression in microglia cells.
0.47840118	To this purpose, IDE expression was silenced through a siRNA-based approach.
0.47194368	IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of sst incubation and as indicated in Figure S1, no detectable modulation of IDE expression was observed.
0.47194368	The lack of similar evidence in supernatants from IDE-silenced cells suggests that the decrease in Aβ levels is fully attributable to the modulation of IDE activity secreted before sst administration.
0.45958263	The sst-mediated up-regulation of IDE in BV-2 cells was further checked by quantifying the mRNA using a Real
0.45958263	Therefore, this evidence might explain the discrepancy between sst and its analogue concerning the positive modulation of IDE expression, even though additional factors cannot be ruled out.
0.44076407	In order to determine whether, besides inducing synthesis, sst also stimulates IDE secretion, the enzyme concentration in cell supernatants was quantified 24 hrs after sst administration.
0.44076407	As reported in Figure 2B, the neuropeptide induces the increase of IDE secretion in a similar way to WB and RT-PCR (Figue 1B and 2A).
=========================================================
========================================================
Question: In which cell line was the gene expression regulation of IDE characterized?
0.722504	It is interesting to note that WB analysis on cell lysates of sst-stimulated N9 microglia cell line confirms the enhancing effect on IDE expression (data not shown).
0.2939241	g001 Since there was no principle difference in the response to somatostatin in microglia cell lines compared to primary rat microglia, immortalized BV-2 cells were subsequently used.
0.18370256	BV-2, a murine microglial cell line, was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutammine (2 mM), penicillin (50 IU/ml), streptomycin (50 µg/ml), sodium pyruvate (1 mM) and ciprofloxacin (0.03 mM).
0.14282402	Somatostatin regulates IDE activity enhancing IDE-dependent Aβ degradation.
0.13465579	Modulation of IDE expression by somatostatin.
0.11902003	This result indicates that somatostatin acts not only by modulating IDE expression, but also by affecting IDE secretion and increasing the amount of the enzyme in the extracellular space.
0.11782381	g002 Somatostatin effect on IDE secretion
0.11782381	g003 Octreotide modulation of IDE expression
0.11782381	We previously demonstrated that sst is an allosteric modulator of IDE [17].
0.116615325	Following a previous observation where somatostatin directly interacts with IDE, here we demonstrate that somatostatin regulates Aβ catabolism by modulating IDE proteolytic activity in IDE gene-silencing experiments.
=========================================================
========================================================
Question: Which method was applied to measure the quantity of IDE mRNA in the gene regulation experiments described in the paper?
1.0604657	A time-course investigation reveals that IDE mRNA increases linearly with the sst concentration within 5 hrs to incubation and turns back after 24 hrs, suggesting a transcriptional effect triggered by sst in BV2 cells (Figure 2A).
0.30074513	Find this article online Bradford MM (1976) A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding.
0.1371592	(A) IDE mRNA increases after 5 hrs of incubation with somatostatin (white columns); 24 hrs after incubation, the level is similar to the control (grey columns).
0.11830752	Materials and Methods Top Materials
0.0857245	Somatostatin triggers IDE gene transcription and protein which displays a different turnover rate: IDE-mRNA reaches a maximum of transcription within 5 hrs after stimulation, returning to the basal level within 24 hrs, whereas the protein concentration increases in cell lysates and supernatants at later times, being still clearly evident after 24 hrs.

========================================================
Question: What regulates the production of neprilysin?
1.7079189	In addition to their ability to phagocyte β-amyloid, microglia can also clear Aβ by degradation through the production of Aβ-degrading enzymes, such as IDE, neprilysin and MMP-9 [29], [33], [39].
0.826492	Somatostatin seems to be also involved in the regulation of neprilysin activity by affecting its expression and its synaptic localization [22].
0.5785444	Several proteases, such as insulin-degrading-enzyme (IDE), neprilysin (NEP) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) are involved in Aβ degradation [4]–[6].
0.4721402	IDE concentration was determined by using a TMB colorimetric kit according to product instructions.
=========================================================
========================================================
Question: What kind of glial cell is able to phagocyte b-amyloid?
0.27526483	Primary cultures of glial cells were prepared from 2-day-old newborn rats (Sprague–Dawley, Charles River, Calco, Italy).
0.27526483	A layer of astrocytic cells was obtained through the vigorous shaking of a confluent 10-day-old monolayer of mixed glial cells [34].
=========================================================
========================================================
Question: What is the major protease produced by microglia responsible for degrading A?
=========================================================
========================================================
Question: What substance exhibited a similar effect on  IDE secretion as achieved by somatostatin?
2.0756865	This result indicates that somatostatin acts not only by modulating IDE expression, but also by affecting IDE secretion and increasing the amount of the enzyme in the extracellular space.
1.9439464	Interestingly, we also observed that in astrocytes, incubation with somatostatin does not have any significant detectable effect of IDE expression, reinforcing the physiological relevance of somatostatin action on IDE secretion in microglia cells.
1.5730091	g002 Somatostatin effect on IDE secretion
1.334979	Through this pathway, somatostatin enhances IDE secretion, strengthening the pool of active enzymes which interact with β-amyloid and other IDE extracellular substrates.
0.96353674	Modulation of IDE expression by somatostatin.
0.8946519	Somatostatin analogue octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion.
0.8946519	It is known that IDE and somatostatin levels are altered in AD progression [3], [20].
0.8717826	Following a previous observation where somatostatin directly interacts with IDE, here we demonstrate that somatostatin regulates Aβ catabolism by modulating IDE proteolytic activity in IDE gene-silencing experiments.
0.8602095	Here, we show that, like somatostatin, octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion, although the effects are generally reduced compared to the endogenous modulator.
0.8602095	As a whole, the reported data indicate that somatostatin regulates IDE expression, secretion and catalytic activity in microglia.

Question: What are the sst receptors that are expressed on rat astrocytes?
5.056796	In order to assess whether the effect of sst on IDE expression is a microglia characteristic, rat astrocytes which display three sst receptor subtypes as well (SSTR-1, SSTR-2, and SSTR-4) [37] were incubated with the same somatostatin concentrations (Figure S1).
1.023898	Rat Astrocytes were incubated with indicated concentrations of somatostatin.
=========================================================
========================================================
Question: What method was used to inhibit the expression of IDE?
2.2126832	This addition further amplifies the positive modulation of IDE expression (Figure 1).
2.2126832	Somatostatin induces an increase of IDE expression in microglia cells.
2.2126832	To this purpose, IDE expression was silenced through a siRNA-based approach.
2.0720837	Therefore, this evidence might explain the discrepancy between sst and its analogue concerning the positive modulation of IDE expression, even though additional factors cannot be ruled out.
2.0482795	IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of sst incubation and as indicated in Figure S1, no detectable modulation of IDE expression was observed.
1.9804752	Modulation of IDE expression by somatostatin.
1.9314841	Therefore, these findings indicate that octreotide and sst exert a very similar effect on IDE expression and secretion in BV-2 cells (see Figures 1, 2 and 4).
1.9314841	It is thus conceivable that sst depletion results in a decrease of IDE expression and secretion contributing to the pathological deposition of β-amyloid in the brain.
1.9314841	Western blot analysis of normalized lysis samples indicates that no detectable effect of IDE expression is observed (left panel).

Question: What cell type in AD brains shows mitochondrial defects?
0.23982537	Accumulation of amyloid-beta in AD brains is thought to underlie neuronal dysfunction and memory loss, being centrally implicated in AD pathogenesis.
0.23982537	Mitochondrial abnormalities have been found both in neurons and astrocytes [35–37], suggesting that both neurons and astrocytes might be damaged by free radicals in the AD brain.
=========================================================
========================================================
Question: In which anatomical structure in the brain does amyloid-beta aggregate?
0.052291296	Increased oxidative stress levels have been found in the brains of patients with AD in Sweden and early in Tg2576 APP transgenic mice [12, 13].
0.052291296	Accumulation of amyloid-beta in AD brains is thought to underlie neuronal dysfunction and memory loss, being centrally implicated in AD pathogenesis.
0.052291296	The brain is vulnerable to oxidative stress owing to its high lipid content, its relatively high oxygen metabolism, and its low levels of antioxidant defenses [26].

0.7594923	Three Questions  The key test for many activists, however, will lie in how Tobias responds to three major questions regarding the Bush administration's global AIDS policies, of which Emergency Program is the central feature.

Question: What types of drug are used by the U.S. Administration for the Emergency Program?
0.684904	While the administration has suggested it will use generics in the Emergency Program, it has not been made a formal decision.
0.3995273	Three Questions  The key test for many activists, however, will lie in how Tobias responds to three major questions regarding the Bush administration's global AIDS policies, of which Emergency Program is the central feature.
0.28537664	Tobias, who retired from Lilly in 1998 and more recently has served as vice chairman of AT&T, where he also worked before going to Lilly in the early 1990s, is supposed to receive the rank of ambassador and report to Secretary of State Colin Powell, a major force behind a five-year, 15-billion-dollar anti-AIDS initiative--called the "Emergency Program"--first proposed by Bush last January and approved by Congress in a somewhat amended form in May.
0.10235902	The first concern involves the availability of generic anti-AIDS and other life-saving drugs to poor countries under the Program.
0.10235902	Big Pharma has been cited as a major culprit behind the administration's niggardliness towards the Fund because of its support for making generic anti-AIDS drugs accessible to all needy countries.
0.09047344	While major pharmaceutical companies have sharply cut prices on their brand-name anti-viral medicines for AIDS victims in poor African countries, similar generic drugs produced in India, Thailand, and Brazil, for example, still cost significantly less--as little as under $300 per person per year for triple combinations of anti-retroviral drugs.
0.07676926	A related question is whether Tobias will push the administration to follow through on its promise at the World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial meeting in Doha in November 2001 to permit poor countries that face public-health emergencies to import generic anti-AIDS and other life-saving drugs.
0.06397439	"Both the people of Africa and the people of the United States will lose if the president's AIDS initiative fails to use the lowest-cost, generic medications," Zeitz said, noting that the pharmaceutical companies have successfully pressed the Bush administration to go back on an earlier pledge to carve out an exception in international patent laws that would enable needy countries to import generic anti-AIDS drugs.
0.06397439	Advocacy groups called for senators to closely scrutinize Tobias' credentials and philosophy and determine whether, given his past ties to the industry, he will be able to fight on behalf of the millions of poor HIV/AIDS victims in desperate need of cheap anti-retroviral drugs in the face of opposition from the major western pharmaceutical companies, often referred to as Big Pharma.

Question: Where were the agreements on international patent law signed?
4.3183494	Under pressure from Big Pharma, the administration has since reversed its position by pressing its bilateral trade partners in Africa to sign agreements committing them to respect international patent laws that, from a practical viewpoint, would make importing generics much more problematic.
1.3696145	"Both the people of Africa and the people of the United States will lose if the president's AIDS initiative fails to use the lowest-cost, generic medications," Zeitz said, noting that the pharmaceutical companies have successfully pressed the Bush administration to go back on an earlier pledge to carve out an exception in international patent laws that would enable needy countries to import generic anti-AIDS drugs.

Question: When did mortality begin to decrease in Africa?
2.2769313	With PEPFAR and greater availability of ARVs, AIDS-related mortality began to decline in sub-Saharan Africa in 2005.
0.63814986	The assertion that HIV originated in Africa is politically sensitive, with some believing that the western scientists have falsely blamed Africa for a disease that really began in the United States.
0.4512401	Whatever its origins, HIV/AIDS became a severe epidemic in East Africa in the 1980s.
0.4512401	South Africa began to lobby intransigent multibillion-dollar pharmaceutical companies to allow the drugs to be produced locally.
0.4512401	Ö Many people in Africa have never seen a clock or a watch their entire lives.
0.36099207	Thirty-three million people worldwide were living with AIDS in 2010, with sub-Saharan Africa bearing the brunt.
0.36099207	In South Africa, where the epidemic has become the largest in the world with over 5 million HIV-infected people, white leaders refused to implement an AIDS education program.
0.36099207	AIDS in Black America  While the number of new HIV infections has substantially dropped in sub-Saharan Africa, it has changed very little in the United States, especially in African-American communities.
0.36099207	Distant Africa may seem to have little relevance to the United States, but now the ìDark Continentî is shining a light on a way out of the worst epidemic in history.
0.31586808	AIDS in Africa  It is thought that a strain of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) in a number of chimpanzee colonies in Cameroon was the viral ancestor of HIV-1, which causes AIDS in humans.

========================================================
Question: How can AIDS in the United States be more successfully approached? 
2.6357875	Since the beginning of the epidemic, over 600,000 people have died of AIDS in the United States, and 1.2 million people are currently living with HIV.
2.6357875	AIDS in Black America  While the number of new HIV infections has substantially dropped in sub-Saharan Africa, it has changed very little in the United States, especially in African-American communities.
2.6357875	î  PEPFARís goal was to share with the world the best practices established in the United States during the first 20 years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
1.7378614	Estimates indicate an infection rate of approximately 56,000 a year in the United States.
1.4482177	The assertion that HIV originated in Africa is politically sensitive, with some believing that the western scientists have falsely blamed Africa for a disease that really began in the United States.
1.1585742	However, as PEPFAR approaches the end of its first decade, the program can now do the reverse: apply best practices from abroad to the United States, particularly in poor, black populations.
1.1585742	In the United States, HIV infection is often seen only through a medical prism, but PEPFAR has shown that social support is a vital part of rendering care to people living with the disease.

Question: What is PEPFAR recommending?
1.4282925	The PEPFAR approach, although not perfect, strongly suggests that such approaches would be beneficial in poverty-stricken areas of cities such as Washington, D.C.  PEPFAR advocates shifting responsibility for HIV testing and counseling away from overwhelmed healthcare providers to community and lay health workers.
1.3466072	With PEPFAR and greater availability of ARVs, AIDS-related mortality began to decline in sub-Saharan Africa in 2005.

0.11707148	In fact, the politics that drive U.S. AIDS policy--and sexual and reproductive health policy in general--have swung so far to the right that many in the United States are no longer outraged by the truly outrageous.
0.10347755	And the fundamentalist attack on abortion rights--which now permeates U.S. international health policy--continues to fuel the spread of AIDS.
0.08278204	But while the world's collective understanding is gradually advancing, U.S. AIDS policy remains mired in a right-wing economic and social vision that is curtailing progress and costing lives.
0.08278204	One place to begin is to recognize how financial greed, religious dogma, and hostility toward women's rights are fueling AIDS policy.
0.08278204	Contempt for Women's Rights  Current U.S. AIDS policy gives drug companies control over treatment options and allows religious fundamentalists to dominate prevention strategies.
0.08278204	This union of greed and dogma has produced an AIDS policy that undermines women's human rights at a time when HIV infects more women than ever before.
0.08278204	And U.S. policy should be brought into compliance with the action plan developed by public health and women's rights advocates at the 1994 UN Conference on Population and Development.
0.08278204	You don't need to memorize the latest UN AIDS report to know that corporate greed and religious dogma are no substitute for a human rights-based international AIDS policy.

3.484584	But while the world's collective understanding is gradually advancing, U.S. AIDS policy remains mired in a right-wing economic and social vision that is curtailing progress and costing lives.

Question: What is Bill Clinton's tendency?
1.799134	The latest trend, embodied by Bill Clinton, is to haggle with drug companies for reduced prices or donations.
=========================================================
========================================================
Question: What are countries of the Global South asking for?
6.505874	But charity is not what the countries of the Global South are asking for.
0.26785517	Patents that allow drug companies based in the United States and Europe to control the manufacture and sale of AIDS medicines prevent countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America from providing people with cheaper, generic AIDS drugs (even though 95% of AIDS patients are in those countries).
0.25253627	As a result, clinics that once offered a range of critical health services--including AIDS treatment and prevention programs for women in some of the poorest countries--have been forced to close.
0.22096923	Meanwhile, the nine largest US drug companies turned a profit of nearly $43 billion dollars last year--more than the gross national income of some of the worst AIDS-affected countries.
0.22096923	On the contrary, in Uganda, it took only two years for HIV rates to double after U.S. missionaries-turned-policymakers effectively shifted the emphasis of the country's AIDS prevention programs from condom use to abstinence.
=========================================================
========================================================
Question: Why is abstinence not enough to reduce the spread of HIV?
5.0202727	But moralizing about abstinence does not reduce the spread of HIV.
0.8986553	Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA) has also introduced a bill to repeal the requirement that one-third of U.S. HIV/AIDS prevention funding be dedicated to programs that prescribe abstinence.
0.7863234	On the contrary, in Uganda, it took only two years for HIV rates to double after U.S. missionaries-turned-policymakers effectively shifted the emphasis of the country's AIDS prevention programs from condom use to abstinence.
0.52653813	Keroack believes that publicly funded sexual education should consist almost entirely of abstinence promotion.
0.48423058	And the fundamentalist attack on abortion rights--which now permeates U.S. international health policy--continues to fuel the spread of AIDS.
0.38738447	The Global Fund--which relies on generic medicines, operates within a human rights framework, and facilitates international cooperation--is the best-situated institution for combating the spread of AIDS worldwide.
0.3760987	Yet Bush continues to favor right-wing Christian organizations that preach abstinence in disbursing federal AIDS funding.
0.30087894	Today, a full one-third of international U.S. AIDS prevention funding is mandated for programs that promote either abstinence or fidelity as prevention strategies.
0.30087894	The abstinence-and-fidelity mantra of the religious right endangers women by ignoring the fact that many women lack the power to refuse sex--especially from their husbands.
0.18556088	He has stacked his Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS with religious fundamentalists and incompetent ideologues.

Question: Why does AIDS policy go hand in hand with greed and dogma?
1.5348184	One place to begin is to recognize how financial greed, religious dogma, and hostility toward women's rights are fueling AIDS policy.
1.5348184	This union of greed and dogma has produced an AIDS policy that undermines women's human rights at a time when HIV infects more women than ever before.
1.5348184	You don't need to memorize the latest UN AIDS report to know that corporate greed and religious dogma are no substitute for a human rights-based international AIDS policy.
0.5187387	Greed and Dogma  After another three million AIDS deaths this year around the world, the Bush administration is still prioritizing pharmaceutical industry profits over people's access to medicine.
0.5044736	Then we can begin to address the gap between what AIDS policy is and what it should be.
0.31634155	Nor are they asking for religious dogma.
0.2522368	But while the world's collective understanding is gradually advancing, U.S. AIDS policy remains mired in a right-wing economic and social vision that is curtailing progress and costing lives.

Question: Has the "global gag rule" been repealed?
7.0707884	Now that the Democrats control both houses of Congress, we should push for another vote to repeal the "global gag rule."
5.892324	The "global gag rule" has pulled U.S. funding from any health organization that provides information about abortion.
=========================================================
========================================================
Question: Why should medicines not be included in the World Trade Organisation patent rules?
0.14408582	Their health so often neglected within families and communities, women have the least access to costly AIDS medicines.
0.14408582	Rather, like food and water, medicine should be excluded from World Trade Organization patent rules.
0.115268655	Greed and Dogma  After another three million AIDS deaths this year around the world, the Bush administration is still prioritizing pharmaceutical industry profits over people's access to medicine.
0.115268655	To realize those goals, federal AIDS programs should rely on generic AIDS medicines--which, at a fraction of the cost of patented brands, are the key to ensuring universal access to treatment.
0.115268655	The Global Fund--which relies on generic medicines, operates within a human rights framework, and facilitates international cooperation--is the best-situated institution for combating the spread of AIDS worldwide.
0.100860074	And since CAFTA passed by such a slim margin last year, November's victories may offer a real possibility for future trade deals that actually comply with U.S. obligations to allow the manufacture and sale of generic medicines.
0.08645149	Patents that allow drug companies based in the United States and Europe to control the manufacture and sale of AIDS medicines prevent countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America from providing people with cheaper, generic AIDS drugs (even though 95% of AIDS patients are in those countries).

0.35395554	And since CAFTA passed by such a slim margin last year, November's victories may offer a real possibility for future trade deals that actually comply with U.S. obligations to allow the manufacture and sale of generic medicines.
0.35395554	That means renegotiating recent trade deals, such as the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), that skirt commitments made in Doha and prevent governments from providing generic drugs to people living with AIDS.

Question: What reduces the spread of HIV?
4.0174837	But moralizing about abstinence does not reduce the spread of HIV.

0.3478171	He has stacked his Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS with religious fundamentalists and incompetent ideologues.
0.27825367	In sub-Saharan Africa, where 65% of this year's new HIV infections occurred, being married actually increased a woman's chance of contracting the virus.
0.27825367	This union of greed and dogma has produced an AIDS policy that undermines women's human rights at a time when HIV infects more women than ever before.
0.27825367	This year's notable appointment was of Herbert Lusk, a vocally anti-gay pastor with no HIV-related experience.
0.27825367	Next fiscal year's HIV/AIDS budget should reflect the U.S. commitment to fund its fair share of the UN Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria.
0.27825367	Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA) has also introduced a bill to repeal the requirement that one-third of U.S. HIV/AIDS prevention funding be dedicated to programs that prescribe abstinence.

0.08041789	Rather than a fundamentalist fantasy of stamping out sex, AIDS prevention strategies should be grounded in what we know works: education and access to condoms within a framework that promotes women's and girls' rights to negotiate sex and make the best choices for their well-being.

0.10831382	Something that once would have sounded utterly insane, like requiring health clinics around the world to sign a loyalty oath condemning prostitution, today passes for business as usual.

Question: Did president Obama commit to $50 billion dollars over the next 5 years to fight AIDS?
3.5489194	As such, it is vital to make sure that all of the candidates know that one of the key pieces needed to fight AIDS is adequate funding: $50 billion dollars over the next 5 years.
3.1407773	More specifically, in this particular instance, our goal was targeted at Presidential hopefuls Obama and Edwards to get them to commit to $50 billion dollars over the next 5 years to fight AIDS, a funding level that experts agree will be needed to turn the tide of the AIDS epidemic.
1.0565373	We asked if he would support $50 billion over the next 5 years for HIV/AIDS; he stated that he had already confirmed his support for more HIV/AIDS funding, but would not give a definitive answer on our specific demand.
0.9244701	This is especially the case with President Bush’s recent announcement of to reauthorize PEPFAR (President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief), which allocates $30 billion over the next 5 years for HIV/AIDS funding.
0.06524934	He then commended our effort; and proceeded to talk about HIV/AIDS in his speech.
0.06524934	HIV/AIDS is a crisis of our time, and we must stand up and address it.
0.057672814	More importantly, though, it is crucial that the next president not just talk about AIDS but commit to a specific, comprehensive plan to fight AIDS.
0.056507584	The ’08 Stop AIDS Platform The ’08 Stop AIDS Platform is something that we must all take heed of: our next President must do more to stop the HIV/AIDS crisis.
0.048937004	By 2010, there will be as many as 20 million children orphaned by AIDS.
0.048937004	So pay attention to what the candidates are saying about HIV/AIDS – and remember that you can use your voice to demand change.
=========================================================
========================================================
Question: Are the U.S. providing treatment for one-third of the people who need it?
4.639713	This number represents one-third of the people living with AIDS and in immediate need of treatment – as the U.S. represents one-third of the world’s wealth, it follows that we should be responsible for providing treatment for one-third of the people who need it.
0.70599854	The ’08 Stop AIDS Platform calls for a new vision on U.S. HIV/AIDS policy, a chief component of which is to provide $50 billion by 2013 to fight HIV/AIDS, and to double the number of people on treatment supported by the United States from two million to four million.
0.54040694	Unfortunately, the number of people in need of treatment is only increasing, and UNAIDS projects that over 10 million people will be in need of treatment by 2010.
0.38212538	Within the United States, HIV/AIDS is disproportionately affecting people of color, and prevention and treatment are still underfunded; strong leadership is needed to defeat the epidemic.
0.38212538	The original PEPFAR, announced in 2003, aimed to prevent 7 million new infections and treat 2 million people (1/3 of those in need of treatment).
0.34259892	The ’08 Stop AIDS Platform, written by a coalition of nearly a dozen US organizations in consultation with people in impoverished countries and supported by over 127 national and international organizations, is based on the premise that our politicians need to keep their promise and devise and implement a plan so treatment access for the millions of people affected by HIV/AIDS becomes a reality.
0.1593438	As global leaders stall at their commitment, everyday another 15,000 people become infected with HIV and 8,200 people die from the disease.
0.15774232	Moreover, the program aims to treat 2.5 million people by 2013.
0.15339305	Our message, however, is the same to all of the candidates, regardless of political party: the current U.S. policies toward HIV/AIDS are woefully inadequate.
0.12615529	The rhetoric spoken at the G8 Summit must turn into action – and it is up to us to make our next president step up and keep our share of the promise for treatment access.
=========================================================
========================================================
Question: What plans have been developed to provide Universal Access to AIDS Treatment?
2.0853882	In 2005, at the G8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, the leaders of the world’s most powerful countries promised Universal Access to AIDS Treatment by 2010.
0.31738058	However, as of today, no concrete plans to make this goal actually come to fruition have been developed.
0.22670041	More importantly, though, it is crucial that the next president not just talk about AIDS but commit to a specific, comprehensive plan to fight AIDS.
0.15869029	This is especially the case with President Bush’s recent announcement of to reauthorize PEPFAR (President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief), which allocates $30 billion over the next 5 years for HIV/AIDS funding.
0.13602024	The ’08 Stop AIDS Platform, written by a coalition of nearly a dozen US organizations in consultation with people in impoverished countries and supported by over 127 national and international organizations, is based on the premise that our politicians need to keep their promise and devise and implement a plan so treatment access for the millions of people affected by HIV/AIDS becomes a reality.
=========================================================
========================================================
Question: How did activists attempt to make AIDS a well-known problem?
0.4595712	Back in the 1980s, AIDS activists employed this technique of “birdogging” (going to the public appearance of a target and trying to get him or her to commit to a new policy) to put the HIV/AIDS crisis on the map.
0.4595712	The Future The original PEPFAR announcement came in large part as a result of pressure from AIDS activists demanding that more be done to combat HIV/AIDS.
